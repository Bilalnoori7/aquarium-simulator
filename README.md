# Aquarium Simulation System

An object-oriented aquarium simulation application built in C++ that features realistic fish behaviors, XML-based storage, and event-driven architecture.

## Project Features

This application implements:
- XML document loading and parsing for aquarium configuration
- Timer-based animation system for fish movement
- Multiple fish types with different behaviors
- Physics-based movement including swimming patterns and direction changes
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

## Key Implementation Details

- **XML Integration**: Custom parser for loading aquarium configurations
- **Polymorphic Fish Behavior**: Different fish classes implement unique movement patterns
- **Timer Events**: Event-driven system for animation and state updates
- **File Management**: Save/load functionality with proper error handling
- **Spatial Algorithms**: Random number generation for natural movement
- **UI Components**: File open menu, clear procedures, and interactive controls

## Object-Oriented Principles Applied

- **Inheritance Hierarchy**: Base fish class extended by specific behaviors
- **Polymorphism**: Each fish type implements movement differently
- **Encapsulation**: Internal states protected through proper access modifiers
- **Event Handling**: Timer-based updates trigger appropriate behaviors

## Technical Challenges Solved

- Implementation of realistic swimming patterns
- Handling XML tag attributes efficiently
- Managing elapsed time for consistent animation
- Creating reversible and flippable fish movements
- Optimizing performance through speed adjustments
